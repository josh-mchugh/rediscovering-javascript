# Chapter 5
Anonymous functions have been in JavaScript from day one. Arrow functions are new and declutter the code and make the code more expressive. Arrow functions are NOT a direct replacement for anonymous functions. Arrow functions can promote functional style programming and its benefits.

## anonymous-to-arrow.js
In this example we take an anonymous function and convert it to an arrow function to demonstrate how the arrow function can make small anonymous functions more expressive and easier to read.

## single-parameter-arrow.js
This example demonstrates how an arrow function does not require the parentheses if the function has a single parameter. A arrow function with an empty parameter list or a parameter list with more than 1 parameter will require parameteses.

## rest-parameter-arrow.js
We demonstrate how the arrow function can use the rest parameter. In this example we take a message and subjects. It can take one more paramters to display the message.
