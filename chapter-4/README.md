# Chapter 4
This chapter covers enchanced loops to improve interating over collections. The new primitive type 'Symbol' and how it acts as interfaces for JavaScript. Generators and how they can help create infinite sequences.

## traditional-for.js
This example demonstrates the classic for loop iteration within JavaScript and how it resembiles the widely used constructs in C-like languages.

## enchanced-for.js
This is an example of the for...of enchanced for loop. It is a simplier for loop iteration with concise and clean code. Implmenting the enchanced for...of loop can help create less error prone code.

## using-entries.js
This example demonstrates the use of entries from the enchanced for...of loop. The entries allows us to get the index and value of an object while in the for loop. The entry return two values, the index and the value at that index.
