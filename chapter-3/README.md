# Chapter 3
This chapter we take a dive into JavaScript functions and improvements with the latest JavaScript versions. Look into spread parameters and arrows fuctions and how they improve readability and cleaner code.

## max.js
This example show how JavaScripts functions can be called with more parameters than declared and still operate and ignore the extra pameters. If fewer parameters are passed, it will declare those parameters as undeclared.

## arguments.js
This example shows how JavaScript used to rely on a type called Arguments. It still does becase of backwards compability. In this example it demonstrates a function can be declared with zero paramters but can be still passed many and worked upon because of this `arguments` object. It is recommended to use `rest parameter` going forward and not rely on `arguments`.

## restmax.js
This example shows the rest parameter and how it has a better method signature for expressing a variable with any number of arguments. The rest paramter allows of to do everything the arguments functionality did but with cleaner code and more functionality.
