# Chapter 7
It is now possible to create clean Object Oriented code with JavaScript. JavaScript now allows for a new way of creating classes, instances and static members. Within the new improvements we will be able to create clean and less error prone classes Object Orient programming with a ix of functional programming.

## define-class.js
JavaScript added the keyword 'class' which makes it obvious and unambiguous. The keyword is followed by an optional name of the class and any empty {} is the minimum syntax to define a class.

## no-hoisting.js
Class function calls cannot be called before the class definition. Calling the function before the definition will create a 'ReferenceError'.
