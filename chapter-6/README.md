# Literals and Destructing
In this chapter we look at new features within JavaScript to reduce noise and clutter within code. Template literals, multiline strings, object literals, and destructing are new ways to reduce the code clutter and improve readability and ease of coding.

## template-literals.js
Template literals are strings with embedded expressions. The expressions may be a single variable, multiple variables with operations, a function call, or combinations of them.

## template-confusion.js
Template literals are evaluated when the template literal is evaluate. This is something to keep in mind as it can lead to confusion and another reason we should honor immutability whenever possible.
